# Colin King Profile Statement


Colin is a former shearer, family man and industry leader who has served on the NZ meat Board, Beef and Lamb Board, owned successful businesses and holds a double mayor degree in Accounting and Management. Most recently he served as the MP for the Marlborough region for 9 years.

He wants Marlborough to thrive and create the kind of jobs that would allow our children and grandchildren to live here and benefit from the traditional Marlborough lifestyle.

He believes Marlborough deserves a mayor and leader equally attuned to business and central government as he is to the local community. We need a mayor who is able to unite council, to be ambitious for everyone living in Marlborough.

Colin recognises that council cannot continually increase rates above the rate of inflation, in order to cover its increased spending, because ever increased spending hurts those who can least afford it.
