# Laressa Shenfield Profile Statement


My personal values drive my conduct and credibility as your council representative. I am trustworthy; I have demonstrated fairness, honesty and integrity over the last 3 years on council. Demanding open and transparent council process is paramount to building community confidence and key to the reputation of council.

I have the passion, energy, experience and leadership skills to move the region forward in a positive way.

I advocate for:

* Sensible and accountable use of ratepayer funds and cash reserves with a focus on core council activities as priorities
* A ‘can do’ culture that enables business investment and innovation
* Opportunities and facilities for our young people to get the support they need to succeed

I currently sit on:

* Community &amp; Finance Committee
* Environment Committee
* Hearings Committee
* Youth Council
* Accredited Resource Management Commissioner

I am an active volunteer with a genuine heart for others and our community. I Chair the Dillons Point Playgroup, am a member of MVIP Positive Ageing and Youth Workers Collective. Prior to being on council I worked and travelled abroad and have a diverse management background holding various senior roles. I am also a working parent raising children 4 &amp; 6 with my husband Rich.

It is impossible to achieve anything in council on your own; you are 1 vote in 14 around the table. I know from experience how important it is to stay firmly connected to the community, have a clear vision, build relationships, and work collaboratively with others to get things done.

I ask for your continued support, Vote Back Laressa Shenfield.
