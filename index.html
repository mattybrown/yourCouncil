      <strong>Position running for:</strong> Marlborough Sounds Ward</p>
      <p>
        My principal place of residence is in the Marlborough Sounds Ward.<br />
        As one of three councillors representing the people of the Marlborough Sounds, I will attend faithfully to the interests of Sounds residents and land owners by consulting widely and applying myself industriously to the issues that concern them most. I have served as chairman of the French Pass Residents for the past eight years, during which time I have successfully engaged with members of the community holding divergent views on a range of issues, seeking always to find common ground with reason and patience.<br />
        My life experience includes working with children at risk, establishing a vineyard and winery, building the traditional sailing vessel, Steadfast, with which I operate an educational and tourist charter business out of Picton, and assisting in the management of the French Pass DOC campground.<br />

        Ko ahau he kaipōti i roto i te Marlborough Sounds Ward.<br />
        Ka haere ahau i te pono ki nga ngākau nuitanga o Sounds noho me rangatira whenua mā te kōrero whānui, me te tono ahau itoito ki nga take e arohia ana . Kua mahi ahau rite tiamana o Te Aumiti kainoho mo te waru tau e mua, i roto i nei te wa i pai rawe ahau ki te mau melo o te hapori e pupuri whakaaro weherua i runga i te whānuitanga o ngā take, e whai ana i nga wa katoa ki te kitea whenua noa ki te take.<br />
        Wheako toku ora kau mahi ki ngā tamariki i mōrea, te whakatū i te mara waina, me te whare waina, hanga i te oko rere tuku iho, Tu'uma'u, me i whakahaere ahau i te mahi tūtohinga mātauranga me te tāpoi i roto o Waitohi, a āwhina i roto i te whakahaere o te puninga Te Aumiti mō Te Papa Atawhai.

        Commitment and communication are strengths I bring to working for you, our Sounds community.<br />
        For the past six years as your Councillor I believe I have justified the trust the Marlborough Sounds community placed in me to represent the Ward, to respond to local concerns and to contribute to the growth of Marlborough.<br />
        I initiated Smart and Connected strategy for Marlborough, now with groups in Picton and Havelock, working for change, both for the community and for business. I have led the regional planning initiative, a requirement of Government, to define what Marlborough will be like for the foreseeable future.<br />
        I share with you a love of our area: together we can make a significant contribution to Marlborough, securing an exciting and sustainable future for us all.<br />
        With knowledge, energy and enthusiasm I look forward to working for you, to continue striving for a better tomorrow.

        Easy to reach, willing to listen. I bring drive and enthusiasm to this role. With strong communication skills, I am available to listen to concerns and take issues to council.<br />
        Electing me you will have a proactive voice working your ward, to champion concerns and
        ensure that your communities’ concerns / needs are respected.<br />
        Supporting a variety of commercial and recreational activities, the Marlborough Sounds environs face issues requiring careful management.<br />
        How these challenges are managed which allows for growth but protects the unique qualities is key to the wellbeing of communities’ futures.<br />
        Having operated a business within the region for 29 years, I understand the needs of the communities and have the skills and abilities to seek solutions.<br />
        Council must listen to communities’ needs and where money is spent on facilities, it is in line with communities aspirations. Council must aim for zero rates increase 2017.<br />

      <p>
        My principal place of residence is not within the Marlborough Sounds Ward.<br />
        I am a fourth generation Marlburian with grandchildren attending school in Marlborough.<br />
        In the interest of present and future generations, I have put forward my name to contest the position of Councillor.<br />
        I see the lack of transparency and accountability in Council has delivered the Theatre debacle; coupled with inadequate to nil consultation in formulating the MEP has divided Marlborough.<br />
        Most Marlburians derive their income directly or indirectly from the environment, with approximately 50% of Marlborough locked up in the DOC estate, can society afford the luxury of retiring productive land and water at the expense of job losses and community wellbeing. I see the MEP will deliver this outcome if confirmed in its present form.<br />
        I support Primary Production, Aquaculture, Fishing, Forestry, Agriculture, Tourism and Horticulture.  Council’s job is to install an economic environment in which these industries can prosper with minimal rules, regulation and cost of compliance.

      <p>
        My principal place of residence is in the Marlborough Sounds ward.<br />
        As a local Picton resident I am connected to my community. I am approachable and accessible and I’ve proved this in my work for the community, serving on organisations as diverse as Marlborough Marine Radio, the Picton Foodbank and the Picton Community Early Learning and Waikawa Bay School Boards.<br />
        My promise to you is to continue to put our Sounds communities at the front and centre of my Council work.<br />

        I will advocate for genuine community consultation and for robust financial and political accountability in all Council activities.
      </p>
      <h6>Issues</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to quality and affordable drinking water for all Marlborough towns: Council must prioritise basic needs such as drinking water. Costs must be shared to ensure affordability.</li>
        <li>Freedom camping: If it’s not self-contained and not certified then it should be staying in a private or a DOC camping ground.</li>
        <li>Protecting the quality of life and lifestyle for local Picton, Havelock and Sounds residents: It’s the ordinary things that make a difference  - parking at the height of summer, library services, new footpaths and footpath maintenance, cleaner streams, reliable sewerage and water services, access to Sounds recreational activities through moorings and marinas.</li>
        <li>Promoting Picton as a tourist destination: Picton and the Sounds are the jewel in Marlborough’s tourism crown. They need to be given that position and focus – in resources, event planning, and tourism promotion.</li>
        <li>Protecting the Marlborough Sounds and rivers, from sewerage, storm water, industry run-off and siltation: Our families and visitors deserve clean and swimmable water – river and sea.</li>
        <li>Transparency in Council discussions and decision making; Technology is part of the answer: live-stream Council meetings and also have them available on-demand on the Council website, so that all residents can tune-in at a time that suits them.</li>
        <li>Theatre debt: To date Council has fallen short in its fiscal decision making with this. It need a considered, future focused, plan in place - one that works for the ratepayers.</li>

      <p>Fourth generation Marlburian, Renwick resident 45 years; wife, mother, grandmother.<br />
        For the last three years I have been a voice for heartland Marlborough on Council.  I have a deep passion for this province and its people and have worked hard as a Councillor to; help take Marlborough forward; to represent the interests of all people across this wonderful province and in particular those who live, work and play in the Wairau Awatere Ward.<br />
        In putting my name forward for a second term I pledge again to see: the democratic process upheld; that growth does not come at the expense of the environment; that rural communities and townships are supported in achieving their aspirations; that commonsense decision-making prevails.<br />
        He aha te mea nui?  He tangata! He tangata! He tangata! – What is the most important thing in the world? It is people!
        It is people! It is people!</p>

        Originally from Southland, Tim has a BCom and broad experience in a number of sectors, including agriculture, tourism, marketing, advertising, viticulture and property.<br />
        He and his wife, moved from Auckland to Marlborough in 1993, choosing to raise their family in a regional centre rather than the city, and thinking why wait until retirement before living where you want.<br />
        Because of his background and approachable manner, Tim relates well to people from all walks of life. He has involved himself in numerous community activities, mostly on a voluntary basis and often finishing up the natural leader, providing governance and bringing out the best in people around him.<br />
        Standing on a platform of positive goals, open discussion and common sense, he believes the greatest future for Marlborough continues to be in adding value to primary produce, in tourism and ensuring it remains the best place in New Zealand to live.

        I am seeking re-election to build on opportunities already gained for our land users and small towns. Looking ahead, resourceful Marlborough has a great future based on rural/urban business and community partnerships.<br />
        I established the Rural Advisory Group to draw people together and improve communication within the Wairau-Awatere Ward and with Council.<br />
        RAG, with support from Council staff and input from ward groups, is working on the Environment Plan, broadband/cell phone access, waste solutions and pest management.<br />

        I ask your hard questions, without fear or favour, and expect answers.

        Hi, I’m Cyril Dawson and yes I am running for Council and No I am not related to Brian Dawson.<br />
        I have lived in Blenheim (not Marlborough city) for 43 years and a lot of you will know me through sport, music and my work.<br />
        I am married and have a son and a stepson.<br />
        I was on the Board of Trustees at Blenheim School for 5 years as property manager and am currently president of the Clubs of Marlborough golf section.<br />
        I am going into this election as a Jog Bloggs, grassroots ratepayer wanting to discourage unnecessary spending of ratepayers’ money.<br />
        With a lot of people on fixed or low to middle incomes, the Council have to prioritise where the money is spent.<br />
        People before luxuries, necessities before niceties.<br />
        In conclusion, with your support, we can make this happen.<br />
        Thank you.

      <p>
        Hello, name is Diane Ryan and I am standing for the Blenheim Ward in which I live.<br />
        Blenheim is an amazing place to live, work and retire in. I want to support our people, improve our facilities and ensure the longevity of our fantastic landscape.<br />
        Blenheim has a dynamic, changing population and council decisions must be balanced to meet the needs of the young and the growing retired community. During my first term I intend to focus on these important needs. I also want to see the Council focus on increasing the number of visitors to Marlborough by making the most of our wonderful natural environment and hardworking entrepreneurs.<br />
        As a previous financial and risk management auditor for Auckland Council and experienced business woman I believe I have the skills and passion to do this and will serve you well.<br />
        Thank you for participating in these valuable elections.

      <p>
        It is with a lot of consideration and encouragement received that I stand for re-election.<br />
        Having now completed 2 terms, the last as Deputy Mayor and Chairman of Assets and Services, I have valuable experience to help assist council for the new term.<br />
        As a well known local business man for the last 21 years, coupled with my experiences as a councillor, administrator and sporting communities involvement, I believe I have what is needed, for a well balanced and measured approach that is required to make decisions for the betterment and future of our province.<br />
        Good management of our reserves in recent times has lead us to achieve a number of special projects and still leave us in a strong financial position, which has our council rated highly by national standards, something of which I am proud to have been part of and want to see continued.

      <p>
        I have the energy, skills and now the time to give service to Marlborough, a community I feel privileged to be part of.<br />
        I ‘retired’ at the end of 2015 after a 43 year career in education, the last 24 years as principal of Whitney Street School. I continue to act as a member support person for NZEI, the education union.<br />
        I believe my ability to work positively with a wide range of groups and individuals will be an important asset to bring to the Council forum.<br />
        I offer Council strengths in strategic planning, communication and negotiation skills and the ability to be a good listener. These strengths will contribute to effective Council leadership and decision making.<br />
        I think it’s important to balance my Council commitments with my other interests. These include rugby referee coaching, biking, horse racing, Marlborough wine and helping my wife Jo keep up with eight grandchildren.<br />
        My primary reason in standing for Council is to give service to Marlborough, a community I am privileged to be a part of.
