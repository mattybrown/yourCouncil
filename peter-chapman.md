# Peter Chapman Profile Statement


Peter has over thirty-five years in the corporate world with a background in sales, marketing, product and brand development, contract management and strategic planning. He has served as Chairman of Lifeline Marlborough and on the interim Board of Lifeline New Zealand.

With an interest in the local hospitality sector, two grown daughters, a cat, a 4WD, small boat and a trail bike Peter came to Marlborough ten years ago to live, work &amp; play – stayed and loved it. Peter has a real passion and pride for Marlborough and believes Marlborough can do so much better.

“I believe I am in touch with our communities. I will listen, I will ask the hard questions and do not consider the task a popularity contest but a job requiring the skills, experiences, openness and honesty I have learned in my working career”
